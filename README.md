# EnKF-AI
This repository contains Python 3 implementaitions of ensemble Kalman Filters with adaptive covariance inflation.

In order to run the programs contained in this repository you need at least Python 3.7 and following modules:

- numpy 
- tkinter
- matplotlib
- scipy
- pillow
- csv

There should be eight Python files, three .jpg files, and one .txt file. I will now list the Python files and their purpose.

equilibrium.py given a turbulence regime F the programm starts N = 100 long running simulations of the Lorenz 96 model to and calculates the equilibrium mean, the variance of each node, and the benchmark Error_A.
